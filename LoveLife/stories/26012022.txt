                    The weather is very dim, feels too boring to be doing anything. I woke up nnearly at 9:00am and called Mani, she replied while still sleeping,
                    she was sleeping and I tried waking her up. Eventually she did wake up, but not because of my call but because of a milk tea (Dhud-Chai) ðŸ˜¤. I was shocked to see how energetic

At last, I asked her to let me talk over to her friend (Himanjana), as she was an anime-fanatic too just like me, I hoped that she could understand what I was talking about and all her room-mates asked her to let me go read the manga.
