                    The weather is very dim, feels too boring to be doing anything. I woke up nnearly at 9:00am and called Mani, she replied while still sleeping,she was sleeping and I tried waking her up. Eventually she did wake up, but not because of my call but because of a milk tea (Dhud-Chai) ðŸ˜¤. I was shocked to see how energeticshe can be when she eats ðŸ¥². In the evening, I was angry at her, the reason was quiet simple- she said she was watching the movie "Pushpa", and I said okay, go watch the movie and then call me. Since she was doing something and I was getting bored, I searched for a manga but I found a new Manhwa and it was very intresting.I wanted to complete all the total 49 chapters of that. She called while I was in the middle of reading chapter-17, and I pick up her call, she says she's half part from the movie and would call me when it finishes. I told her that I am reading a manga and she said "okay, fine".Then, when she was finished with her movie, she called me and I asked her if I could read some more of it. But she told me not to do so.I repeatedly asked her to re-consider that, however she did not agree at all. At last, I asked her to let me talk over to her friend (Himanjana), as she was an anime-fanatic too just like me, I hoped that she could understand what I was talking about and all her room-mates asked her to let me go read the manga.Later when I wanted to talk to her as I was on the 28th chapter, she did not pick up my calls then I called her about 15 times and at last I thought that she was just doing that on purpose. Later, she said that she was out for a shopping with her room-mates and her phone was on charge.<br><br>Small fights and arguments are not a bad thing to have, they make our relationship stable and help us understand each other well.
